Coffee Admin Theme is a WordPress dashboard plugin which adjusts the look and feel of the dashboard, via custom themes and fonts.

== Description ==

Coffee Admin Theme gives the dashboard a bolder look with sumptous dark tones and a textured background. The theme is fully compatible with the latest version of WordPress supporting the new fly-out menus. Because of this, the theme will not work as intended in older versions.

The plugin has options to switch between different themes, and I will be adding more themes over time.

You also get a great selection of Google Web Fonts to choose, further enhancing your dashboard experience.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins folder.
2. Active the plugin via the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Make sure you activate the theme via the options page under "Settings > Coffee Theme Options"
4. That's it! Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin breaks my dashboard =

This plugin only hooks into your dashboard, so if it causes problems with your interface simply de-active the plugin and your dashboard will return to normal.

= The theme breaks the styling of some of my plugins options =

It's impossible for me to make sure the styles of this theme work with every plugin out there. It's inevitable that the styles won't work for all plugin option pages in your admin.

= The theme doesn't look right =

Are you using an old browser? This admin theme was designed to be used on the latest browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari Opera and IE9 and above. Support for IE8 and below is not guaranteed.
